Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximates expectations with respect to a
given target distribution,
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ] = \int \mathrm{d}q \, \pi (q) \, f(q),
$$
using the states of a Markov chain, $\{q_{0}, \ldots, q_{N} \}$,
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ] \approx
\hat{f}_{N} = \frac{1}{N + 1} \sum_{n = 0}^{N} f(q_{n}).
$$
These estimators, however, are guaranteed to be accurate only _asymptotically_
as the chain grows to be infinitely long,
$$
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \hat{f}_{N} = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ].
$$

To be useful in applied analyses, we need MCMC estimators to converge to the
true expectation values sufficiently quickly that they are reasonably accurate
before we exhaust our finite computational resources.  This fast convergence
requires strong ergodicity conditions to hold, in particular _geometric
ergodicity_ between a Markov transition and a target distribution.  Geometric
ergodicity is usually the necessary condition for MCMC estimators to follow
a central limit theorem, which ensures not only that they are unbiased even
after only a finite number of iterations but also that we can empirically
quantify their precision using the MCMC standard error.

Unfortunately, proving geometric ergodicity theoretically is infeasible for
any nontrivial problem.  Instead we must rely on empirical diagnostics that
identify obstructions to geometric ergodicity, and hence well-behaved MCMC
estimators.  For a general Markov transition and target distribution, the best
known diagnostic is the split $\hat{R}$ statistic over an ensemble of Markov
chains initialized from diffuse points in parameter space; to do any better we
need to exploit the particular structure of a given transition or target
distribution.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, for example, is especially powerful in this regard as
its failures to be geometrically ergodic with respect to any target distribution
manifest in distinct behaviors that have been developed into sensitive
diagnostics.  One of these behaviors is the appearance of _divergences_ that
indicate the Hamiltonian Markov chain has encountered regions of high curvature
in the target distribution which it cannot adequately explore.

In this case study I will show how divergences signal bias in the fitting of
hierarchical models and how they can be used to study the underlying
pathologies.  I will also show how those pathologies can be mitigated by
utilizing an alternative implementation of the same model.

# The Eight Schools Model

Let's consider a hierarchical model of the the Eight Schools dataset
[@Rubin:1981],

$$\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5)$$

$$\tau \sim \text{Half-Cauchy}(0, 5)$$

$$\theta_{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \tau)$$

$$y_{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta_{n}, \sigma_{n}),$$

where $n \in \left\{1, \ldots, 8 \right\}$ and the
$\left\{ y_{n}, \sigma_{n} \right\}$ are given as data.

Inferring the hierarchical hyperparameters, $\mu$ and $\tau$, together with
the group-level parameters, $\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{8}$, allows the model
to pool data across the groups and reduce their posterior variance.
Unfortunately this pooling also squeezes the posterior distribution into a
particularly challenging geometry that obstructs geometric ergodicity and hence
biases MCMC estimation.

In this case study we'll first examine the direct _centered_ parameterization of
the Eight Schools model and see how divergences identify this bias before there
are any other indications of problems.  We'll then use these divergences to
study the source of the bias and motivate the necessary fix, a reimplementation
of the model with a _non-centered_ parameterization.  For a more thorough
discussion of the geometry of centered and non-centered parameterizations of
hierarchical models see @BetancourtEtAl:2015.

# A Centered Eight Schools Implementation

A centered parameterization of the Eight Schools model is straightforward to
directly implement as a Stan program,
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("eight_schools_cp.stan"))
```

Unfortunately, this direct implementation of the model exhibits a pathological
geometry that frustrates geometric ergodicity.  Even more worrisome, the
resulting bias is subtle and may not be obvious upon inspection of the Markov
chain alone.  To understand this bias, let's consider first a short Markov
chain, commonly used when computational expediency is a motivating factor, and
only afterwards a longer Markov chain.

## A Dangerously-Short Markov Chain

We begin by setting up our R environment,
```{r, comment=NA}
library(rstan)
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
source('stan_utility.R')
```
and then some graphic customizations that we'll use later,
```{r}
c_light <- c("#DCBCBC")
c_light_highlight <- c("#C79999")
c_mid <- c("#B97C7C")
c_mid_highlight <- c("#A25050")
c_dark <- c("#8F2727")
c_dark_highlight <- c("#7C0000")
```

Against the best practices preached by the Stan development team, let's fit
the model in RStan using just a single short chain,
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
input_data <- read_rdump("eight_schools.data.R")

fit_cp <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
            iter=1200, warmup=500, chains=1, seed=483892929, refresh=1200)
```
Although this scenario may appear superficial, it is not uncommon for users to
use short chains when prototyping their analysis, or even for their final
analysis if they are limited by time or computational resources.

For this lone chain split $\hat{R}$ doesn't indicate any problems and the
effective sample size per iteration is reasonable if a bit small,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(fit_cp)
```
Moreover, the trace plots all look fine. Let's consider, for example, the
hierarchical standard deviation, $\tau$ or, more specifically, its logarithm,
$\log \tau$.  Because $\tau$ is constrained to be positive, its logarithm will
allow us to better resolve behavior for small values.  Indeed the chains seems
to be exploring both small and large values reasonably well,
```{r}
params_cp <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_cp, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_cp) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_cp), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_cp), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_cp), fixed = TRUE)
params_cp$iter <- 1:700

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_cp$iter, log(params_cp$tau), col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="Iteration", ylab="log(tau)", ylim=c(-6, 4))
```

Unfortunately, the resulting estimate for the mean of $log(\tau)$ is strongly
biased away from the true value, here shown in grey,
```{r}
running_means <- sapply(params_cp$iter, function(n) mean(log(params_cp$tau)[1:n]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_cp$iter, running_means, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(0, 2),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of log(tau)")
abline(h=0.7657852, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
```

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, however, is not so oblivious to these issues as
almost 2% of the iterations in our lone Markov chain ended with a divergence,
```{r, comment=NA}
check_div(fit_cp)
```
Even with a single short chain these divergences are able to identify the bias
and advise skepticism of any resulting MCMC estimators.

Additionally, because the divergent transitions, here shown here in green, tend
to be located near the pathologies we can use them to identify the location of
the problematic neighborhoods in parameter space,
```{r}
partition <- partition_div(fit_cp)
div_params_cp <- partition[[1]]
nondiv_params_cp <- partition[[2]]

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(nondiv_params_cp$'theta[1]', log(nondiv_params_cp$tau),
     col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8, xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)",
     xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4))
points(div_params_cp$'theta[1]', log(div_params_cp$tau),
       col="green", pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

In this case the divergences are clustering at small values of $\tau$ where the
hierarchical distribution, and hence all of the group-level $\theta_{n}$, are
squeezed together.  Eventually this squeezing would yield the funnel geometry
infamous to hierarchical models, but here it appears that the Hamiltonian Markov
chain is diverging before it can fully explore the neck of the funnel.

## A Safer, Longer Markov Chain

Aware of the potential insensitivity of split $\hat{R}$ on single short chains,
we recommend always running multiple chains as long as possible to have the
best chance to observe any obstructions to geometric ergodicity.  Because it is
not always possible to run long chains for complex models, however, divergences
are an incredibly powerful diagnostic for biased MCMC estimation.

With divergences already indicating a problem for our centered implementation of
the Eight Schools model, let's run a much longer chain to see how the problems
more obviously manifest,
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
fit_cp80 <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
                 iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                refresh=11000)
```
Even with so many more iterations, split $\hat{R}$ does not indicate any
serious issues,
```{r, comment=NA}
check_rhat(fit_cp80)
```
We really need to be incorporating multiple chains for split $\hat{R}$ to be
effective.  Still, note that the effective sample size per iteration has
drastically fallen, indicating that we are exploring less efficiently the longer
we run.  This odd behavior is a clear sign that something problematic is afoot.

The trace plots are more indicative of the underlying pathologies, showing
the chain occasionally "sticking" as it approaches small values of $\tau$,
exactly where we saw the divergences concentrating,
```{r}
params_cp80 <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_cp80, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_cp80) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_cp80), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp80) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_cp80), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp80) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_cp80), fixed = TRUE)
params_cp80$iter <- 1:10000

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_cp80$iter, log(params_cp80$tau), col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="Iteration", ylab="log(tau)", ylim=c(-6, 4))
```

These sticky intervals induce severe oscillations in the MCMC estimators early
on, until they seem to finally settle into biased values,
```{r}
running_means_cp80 <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(log(params_cp80$tau)[1:(10*n)]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp80, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(0, 2),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of log(tau)")
abline(h=0.7657852, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
```

In fact the sticky intervals are the Markov chain trying to correct the biased
exploration.  If we ran the chain even longer then it would eventually get stuck
again and drag the MCMC estimator down towards the true value.  Given an
infinite number of iterations this delicate balance asymptotes to the true
expectation as we'd expect given the consistency guarantee of MCMC.  Stopping
the after any finite number of iterations, however, destroys this balance and
leaves us with a significant bias.

The rate of divergences remains near 2% of all iterations,
```{r, comment=NA}
check_div(fit_cp80)
```
and the increased sampling really allows us to see the truncated funnel geometry
of the Markov chain,
```{r}
partition <- partition_div(fit_cp80)
div_params_cp80 <- partition[[1]]
nondiv_params_cp80 <- partition[[2]]

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(nondiv_params_cp80$'theta[1]', log(nondiv_params_cp80$tau),
     col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8, xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)",
     xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4))
points(div_params_cp80$'theta[1]', log(div_params_cp80$tau),
       col="green", pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

## Mitigating Divergences by Adjusting Stan's Adaptation Routine

Divergences in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo arise when the Hamiltonian transition
encounters regions of extremely large curvature, such as the opening of the
hierarchical funnel.  Unable to accurately resolve these regions, the transition
malfunctions and flies off towards infinity.  With the transitions unable to
completely explore these regions of extreme curvature, we lose geometric
ergodicity and our MCMC estimators become biased.

Stan uses a heuristic to quickly identify these misbehaving trajectories, and
hence label divergences, without having to wait for them to run all the way to
infinity.  This heuristic can be a bit aggressive, however, and sometimes label
transitions as divergent even when we have not lost geometric ergodicity.

To resolve this potential ambiguity we can adjust the step size, $\epsilon$,
of the Hamiltonian transition.  The smaller the step size the more accurate
the trajectory and the less likely it will be mislabeled as a divergence.  In
other words, if we have geometric ergodicity between the Hamiltonian transition
and the target distribution then decreasing the step size will reduce and then
ultimately remove the divergences entirely.  If we do not have geometric
ergodicity, however, then decreasing the step size will not completely remove
the divergences.

Within Stan the step size is tuned automatically during warm up, but we can
coerce smaller step sizes by tweaking the configuration of Stan's adaptation
routine.  In particular, we can increase the ```adapt_delta``` parameter from
 its default value of 0.8 closer to its maximum value of 1.
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
fit_cp85 <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
                 iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                 refresh=11000, control=list(adapt_delta=0.85))

fit_cp90 <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
                 iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                 refresh=11000, control=list(adapt_delta=0.90))

fit_cp95 <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
                 iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                 refresh=11000, control=list(adapt_delta=0.95))

fit_cp99 <- stan(file='eight_schools_cp.stan', data=input_data,
                 iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                 refresh=11000, control=list(adapt_delta=0.99))
```

Despite increasing ```adapt_delta``` and decreasing step size,
```{r}
adapt_delta=c(0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99)
step_scan=c(get_sampler_params(fit_cp80, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'stepsize__'][1],
            get_sampler_params(fit_cp85, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'stepsize__'][1],
            get_sampler_params(fit_cp90, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'stepsize__'][1],
            get_sampler_params(fit_cp95, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'stepsize__'][1],
            get_sampler_params(fit_cp99, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'stepsize__'][1])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(adapt_delta, step_scan, xlab="Adapt Delta", ylab="Adapted Step Size",
     xlim=c(0.79, 1.0), ylim=c(0, 0.2), col=c_dark, type="l", lwd=3)
points(adapt_delta, step_scan, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

the number of divergent transitions remains nearly constant,
```{r}
div_scan=c(sum(params_cp80$divergent),
           sum(get_sampler_params(fit_cp85, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'divergent__']),
           sum(get_sampler_params(fit_cp90, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'divergent__']),
           sum(get_sampler_params(fit_cp95, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'divergent__']),
           sum(get_sampler_params(fit_cp99, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'divergent__']))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(adapt_delta, div_scan, xlab="Adapt Delta", ylab="Number of Divergences",
     xlim=c(0.79, 1.0), ylim=c(0, 400), col=c_dark, type="l", lwd=3)
points(adapt_delta, div_scan, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

This indicates that the Hamiltonian transition is not geometrically ergodic with
respect to the centered implementation of the Eight Schools model.  Indeed, this
is expected given the observed bias.

This behavior also has a nice geometric intuition.  The more we decrease the
step size the more the Hamiltonian Markov chain can explore the neck of the
funnel.  Consequently, the marginal posterior distribution for $\log \tau$
stretches further and further towards negative values with the decreasing step
size,
```{r}
common_breaks=14 * (0:60) / 60 - 9

p_cp80 <- hist(log(extract(fit_cp80)$tau), breaks=common_breaks, plot=FALSE)
p_cp90 <- hist(log(extract(fit_cp90)$tau), breaks=common_breaks, plot=FALSE)
p_cp99 <- hist(log(extract(fit_cp99)$tau), breaks=common_breaks, plot=FALSE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(p_cp99, col=c_dark, main="", xlab="log(tau)", yaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
plot(p_cp90, col=c_mid, add=T)
plot(p_cp80, col=c_light, add=T)
legend("topleft",
       c("Centered, delta=0.80", "Centered, delta=0.90", "Centered, delta=0.99"),
       fill=c(c_light, c_mid, c_dark), bty="n")
```

The deeper into the funnel we explore, however, the more highly-curved and
pathological it becomes.  The chain with the largest ```adapt_delta``` pushes
deeper into the neck of the funnel but still ends up diverging once it probes
too far,
```{r}
partition <- partition_div(fit_cp99)
div_params_cp99 <- partition[[1]]
nondiv_params_cp99 <- partition[[2]]

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(nondiv_params_cp99$'theta[1]', log(nondiv_params_cp99$tau),
     xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)", xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4),
     col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(div_params_cp99$'theta[1]', log(div_params_cp99$tau),
       col="green", pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

The improved exploration is evident when comparing the samples, here without
labeling the divergences, from the chain with the default settings and the
the ```adapt_delta=0.99``` chain,
```{r}
params_cp99 <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_cp99, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_cp99) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_cp99), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp99) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_cp99), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp99) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_cp99), fixed = TRUE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_cp99$theta.1, log(params_cp99$tau),
     xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)", xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4),
     col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params_cp80$theta.1, log(params_cp80$tau), col=c_light, pch=16, cex=0.8)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.80", "Centered, delta=0.99"),
       fill=c(c_light, c_dark), border="white", bty="n")
```

That said, the improved exploration given by decreasing the step size does
not realize geometric ergodicity.  While the bias does decrease with decreasing
step size,
```{r}
params_cp90 <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_cp90, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_cp90) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_cp90), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp90) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_cp90), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_cp90) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_cp90), fixed = TRUE)

running_means_cp90 <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(log(params_cp90$tau)[1:(10*n)]))
running_means_cp99 <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(log(params_cp99$tau)[1:(10*n)]))

plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp80, col=c_light, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(0, 2),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of log(tau)")
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp90, col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp99, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
abline(h=0.7657852, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
legend("bottomright",
       c("Centered, delta=0.80", "Centered, delta=0.90", "Centered, delta=0.99"),
       fill=c(c_light, c_mid, c_dark), border="white", bty="n")
```

it never completely vanishes, even for the extreme setting
of ```adapt_delta=0.99```.

# A Non-Centered Eight Schools Implementation

Although reducing the step size improves exploration, ultimately it only reveals
the true extent the pathology in the centered implementation.  Fortunately,
there is another way to implement hierarchical models that does not suffer from
the same pathologies.

In a non-centered parameterization we do not try to fit the group-level
parameters directly, rather we fit a latent Gaussian variable from which
we can recover the group-level parameters with a scaling and a translation,

$$\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5)$$

$$\tau \sim \text{Half-Cauchy}(0, 5)$$

$$\tilde{\theta}_{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$

$$\theta_{n} = \mu + \tau \cdot \tilde{\theta}_{n}.$$

Because we are actively sampling from different parameters, we should expect,
and indeed observe, a very different posterior distribution.

The Stan program for the non-centered parameterization is almost as simple as
that for the centered parameterization,
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("eight_schools_ncp.stan"))
```

Running the new model in Stan,
```{r, cached=TRUE, comment=NA}
fit_ncp80 <- stan(file='eight_schools_ncp.stan', data=input_data,
                  iter=11000, warmup=1000, chains=1, seed=483892929,
                  refresh=11000)
```
we see that the effective sample size per iteration has drastically improved,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(fit_ncp80)
```
and the trace plots no longer show any "stickyness",
```{r}
params_ncp80 <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_ncp80, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_ncp80) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_ncp80), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_ncp80) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_ncp80), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_ncp80) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_ncp80), fixed = TRUE)
params_ncp80$iter <- 1:10000

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_ncp80$iter, log(params_ncp80$tau), col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="Iteration", ylab="log(tau)", ylim=c(-6, 4))
```

We do, however, we do still see the rare divergence,
```{r, comment=NA}
check_div(fit_ncp80)
```

These infrequent divergences do not seem concentrate anywhere in parameter
space,
```{r}
partition <- partition_div(fit_ncp80)
div_params_ncp80 <- partition[[1]]
nondiv_params_ncp80 <- partition[[2]]

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(nondiv_params_ncp80$'theta[1]', log(nondiv_params_ncp80$tau),
     xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)", xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4),
     col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(div_params_ncp80$'theta[1]', log(div_params_ncp80$tau),
       col="green", pch=16, cex=0.8)
```

which is indicative of the divergences being false positives.  As expected of
false positives, we can remove the divergences entirely by decreasing the step
size,
```{r, cached=TRUE, comment=NA}
fit_ncp90 <- stan(file='eight_schools_ncp.stan', data=input_data,

The more agreeable geometry of the non-centered implementation allows the
Markov chain to explore deep into the neck of the funnel, capturing even the
smallest values of $\tau$ that are consistent with the measurements,
```{r}
params_ncp90 <- as.data.frame(extract(fit_ncp90, permuted=FALSE))
names(params_ncp90) <- gsub("chain:1.", "", names(params_ncp90), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_ncp90) <- gsub("[", ".", names(params_ncp90), fixed = TRUE)
names(params_ncp90) <- gsub("]", "", names(params_ncp90), fixed = TRUE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params_ncp90$theta.1, log(params_ncp90$tau),
     xlab="theta.1", ylab="log(tau)", xlim=c(-20, 50), ylim=c(-6,4),
     col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params_cp99$theta.1, log(params_cp99$tau), col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params_cp90$theta.1, log(params_cp90$tau), col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Centered, delta=0.99",
                        "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark, c_dark_highlight), border="white", bty="n")
```

```{r}
p_ncp90 <- hist(log(params_ncp90$tau), breaks=common_breaks, plot=FALSE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(p_ncp90, col=c_dark_highlight, main="", xlab="log(tau)", yaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
plot(p_cp99, col=c_dark, add=T)
plot(p_cp90, col=c_mid, add=T)

legend("topleft", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Centered, delta=0.99",
                    "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark, c_dark_highlight), bty="n")
```

Consequently, MCMC estimators from the non-centered chain rapidly converge
towards their true expectation values,
```{r}
running_means_ncp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(log(params_ncp90$tau)[1:(10*n)]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp90, col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(0, 2),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of log(tau)")
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp99, col=c_dark, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
abline(h=0.7657852, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Centered, delta=0.99",
                        "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark, c_dark_highlight), border="white", bty="n")
```

# Why wasn't Biased Estimation Previously Identified?

We have seen in these examples that hierarchical models implemented with a
centered parameterization impede the geometric ergodicity of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo, at least when the data are not extremely informative.  The ultimate
importance of the resulting bias, however, depends on the specific application.

If we are interested in the behavior of $\log \tau$ then this bias will be
serious and affect the quality of any inferences drawn from the fit.  Often,
however, one is interested not in the behavior of $\log \tau$ but rather the
behavior of $\tau$.  When we transform from the logarithmic scale to the linear
scale the pathological region of the posterior is compressed into a small volume
and the biases are somewhat mediated,
```{r}
breaks=20 * (0:50) / 50

p_cp <- hist(params_cp90$tau[params_cp90$tau < 20], breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)
p_ncp <- hist(params_ncp90$tau[params_ncp90$tau < 20], breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(p_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, main="", xlab="tau",
     yaxt='n', ann=FALSE, ylim=c(0, 1000))
plot(p_cp, col=c_mid, add=T)
legend("topright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark_highlight), bty="n")
```
```{r}
running_means_cp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(params_cp90$tau[1:(10*n)]))
running_means_ncp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(params_ncp90$tau[1:(10*n)]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp, col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(2, 4.25),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of tau")
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
abline(h=3.575019, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark_highlight), border="white", bty="n")
```

Certainly the bias is not as obvious as it was on the logarithmic scale.

This mediation also affects how the bias propagates to other parameters in the
model.  When we average over both $\mu$ and $\tau$, the small bias of $\tau$
actually compels the marginal posterior for the group-level parameters to be
_narrower_ than they should be,
```{r}
breaks=80 * (0:50) / 50 - 25

p_cp <- hist(params_cp90$theta.1, breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)
p_ncp <- hist(params_ncp90$theta.1, breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(p_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, main="", xlab="theta.1", yaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
plot(p_cp, col=c_mid, add=T)

legend("topright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark_highlight), bty="n")
```

This narrowness does not strongly affect the accuracy of the mean of the
group-level parameters,
```{r}
running_means_cp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(params_cp90$theta.1[1:(10*n)]))
running_means_ncp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) mean(params_ncp90$theta.1[1:(10*n)]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp, col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(4, 7),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC mean of theta.1")
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
abline(h=6.250004, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark_highlight), border="white", bty="n")
```

but it does systematically underestimate the variance for many iterations,
```{r}
running_means_cp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) var(params_cp90$theta.1[1:(10*n)]))
running_means_ncp <- sapply(1:1000, function(n) var(params_ncp90$theta.1[1:(10*n)]))

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(10*(1:1000), running_means_cp, col=c_mid, pch=16, cex=0.8, ylim=c(10, 40),
    xlab="Iteration", ylab="MCMC variance of theta.1")
points(10*(1:1000), running_means_ncp, col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
abline(h=29.78573, col="grey", lty="dashed", lwd=3)
legend("bottomright", c("Centered, delta=0.90", "Non-Centered, delta=0.90"),
       fill=c(c_mid, c_dark_highlight), border="white", bty="n")
```

In practice this bias can be hard to observe if the Markov chain is slow and
the MCMC estimators are noisy, as is common when using older MCMC algorithms
like Random Walk Metropolis and Gibbs samplers.  This may help explain why the
lack of geometric ergodicity in centered implementations of hierarchical models
is so often overlooked in practice.

Ultimately, identifying the breakdown of geometric ergodicity for a given Markov
transition and target distribution indicates only that there is a bias, not how
significant that bias will be.  The precise significance of this bias depends
not only on the structure of the model but also on the details of how inferences
from that model will be applied.  Sometimes an analysis taking these factors
into account can quantify the significance of the bias and potentially deem it
acceptable.  These analyses, however, are extremely subtle, challenging, and
time-consuming.  It is almost always easier to modify the model to restore
geometric ergodicity and unbiased MCMC estimation.

# Conclusion

Divergences are an incredibly sensitive diagnostic for the breakdown of
geometric ergodicity and hence critical guidance for best implementing our
models in practice.  If the divergences can be removed by
increasing ```adapt_delta``` then Hamiltonian Monte Carlo applied to the given
implementation will yield accurate inferences.  If the divergences persist,
however, then the model will need to be reimplemented to avoid biases.
